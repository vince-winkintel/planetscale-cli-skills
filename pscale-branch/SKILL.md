# pscale branch

Create, delete, diff, and manage database branches.

## Common Commands

```bash
# Create branch from main
pscale branch create <database> <branch-name>

# Create branch from specific source
pscale branch create <database> <branch-name> --from <source-branch>

# List all branches
pscale branch list <database>

# Show branch details
pscale branch show <database> <branch-name>

# View schema diff
pscale branch diff <database> <branch-name>

# View schema
pscale branch schema <database> <branch-name>

# Inspect live branch connections (Postgres and Vitess)
pscale branch connections show <database> <branch-name> --format json
pscale branch connections top <database> <branch-name>

# Inspect Vitess routing rules
pscale branch routing-rules get <database> <branch-name>
pscale branch vtctld get-routing-rules <database> <branch-name>
pscale branch vtctld get-shard <database> <branch-name> --keyspace <keyspace> --shard <shard>

# Delete branch
pscale branch delete <database> <branch-name>

# Promote to production
pscale branch promote <database> <branch-name>
```

## Workflows

### Schema Migration Workflow (Standard)

```bash
# 1. Create development branch
pscale branch create my-database feature-migration --from main

# 2. Make schema changes (via shell, ORM, or direct SQL)
pscale shell my-database feature-migration
# ... run ALTER TABLE, CREATE TABLE, etc.

# 3. View changes
pscale branch diff my-database feature-migration

# 4. Create deploy request (safer than direct promotion)
pscale deploy-request create my-database feature-migration

# 5. Deploy via deploy request (see pscale-deploy-request)
```

### Quick Branch for MR/PR

```bash
# Match PlanetScale branch to your MR/PR branch
BRANCH_NAME="feature-add-user-preferences"
pscale branch create my-database $BRANCH_NAME --from main
```

See `scripts/create-branch-for-mr.sh` for automation.

### Schema Comparison

```bash
# Compare branch schema with main
pscale branch diff <database> <branch-name>

# View full branch schema
pscale branch schema <database> <branch-name>

# Export schema to file
pscale branch schema <database> <branch-name> > schema.sql
```

### Connection inspection and safe termination

`pscale branch connections` replaced the older MySQL-only process view with a shared Postgres/Vitess connection view. Prefer JSON output for agent workflows so action IDs are explicit and not truncated.

```bash
# Inspect current connections once
pscale branch connections show <database> <branch-name> --format json

# Watch live connection activity
pscale branch connections top <database> <branch-name>

# Cancel a query only after confirming the query_id with the user
pscale branch connections kill <database> <branch-name> <query-id> --query

# Terminate a connection only after explicit user approval
pscale branch connections kill <database> <branch-name> <connection-id>

# Postgres only: terminate a transaction after explicit user approval
pscale branch connections kill-transaction <database> <branch-name> <transaction-id>
```

Treat `kill` and `kill-transaction` as destructive operational actions: show the selected row, explain the effect, get confirmation, run exactly one action, then verify with `connections show`.

### Routing rules

```bash
# Read routing rules from the branch schema snapshot
pscale branch routing-rules get <database> <branch-name>

# Vitess only: read live routing rules from vtctld/current cluster state
pscale branch vtctld get-routing-rules <database> <branch-name>

# Update routing rules from a file
pscale branch routing-rules update <database> <branch-name> --routing-rules routing-rules.json
```

Use `vtctld get-routing-rules` when debugging propagation/live cluster state; use `routing-rules get` when you need the schema snapshot contract.

### Vitess shard inspection

`pscale branch vtctld get-shard` reads a live shard record from vtctld, including tablet controls and denied tables. It is Vitess-only and requires both `--keyspace` and `--shard`.

```bash
# Inspect an unsharded keyspace
pscale branch vtctld get-shard <database> <branch-name> \
  --keyspace main \
  --shard '-'

# Inspect a sharded keyspace shard
pscale branch vtctld get-shard <database> <branch-name> \
  --keyspace commerce \
  --shard '-80'
```

### Branch Cleanup

```bash
# List all branches
pscale branch list <database>

# Delete merged/stale branches
pscale branch delete <database> <old-branch-name>
```

## Decision Trees

### Should I promote directly or use deploy request?

```
What's your environment?
├─ Production database → ALWAYS use deploy request (safe, reviewable)
├─ Pre-production database with team → Use deploy request (review workflow)
├─ Personal dev database → Direct promotion OK (but deploy request still safer)
└─ Experimental changes → Keep as branch, don't promote
```

### When to create a new branch?

```
What's your goal?
├─ Schema migration for feature → Create branch (from main)
├─ Testing schema changes → Create branch (isolated)
├─ Hotfix schema change → Create branch (from production)
├─ Experiment / spike → Create branch (delete after)
└─ Working on existing schema → Use existing branch
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Branch already exists"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check existing branches
pscale branch list <database>

# Use different name or delete existing
pscale branch delete <database> <existing-branch>
```

### Schema diff shows no changes

**Causes:**
- No schema changes made yet
- Changes not committed in database session
- Comparing branch to itself

**Solution:**
```bash
# Verify schema was modified
pscale branch schema <database> <branch-name>

# Ensure you're in the right branch when making changes
pscale shell <database> <branch-name>
```

### Cannot delete branch

**Error:** "Branch is protected" or "Branch is a production branch"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Demote production branch first
pscale branch demote <database> <branch-name>

# Then delete
pscale branch delete <database> <branch-name>
```

### Branch creation fails

**Common causes:**
- Invalid branch name (spaces, special chars)
- Source branch doesn't exist
- Insufficient permissions

**Solution:**
```bash
# Use valid branch name (alphanumeric, hyphens, underscores)
pscale branch create <database> my-feature-branch --from main

# Verify source branch exists
pscale branch list <database> | grep main
```

## Branch Lifecycle

```
main (production)
  │
  ├─ Create branch ──> feature-branch (development)
  │                         │
  │                         ├─ Make schema changes
  │                         ├─ Test changes
  │                         └─ Create deploy request
  │                               │
  └─ Deploy ←──────────────────────┘
```

## Best Practices

1. **Always create branches from main** for schema changes
2. **Use descriptive branch names** matching MR/PR numbers when applicable
3. **Run diff before deploy request** to review changes
4. **Delete merged branches** to keep branch list clean
5. **Use deploy requests** instead of direct promotion (reviewable, revertable)
6. **Test schema changes** in branch before deploying
