## Workflows

### Switch Between Organizations

```bash
# View current org
pscale org show

# List available orgs
pscale org list

# Switch to different org
pscale org switch my-other-org

# Verify switch
pscale database list --org my-other-org
```

### Inspect organization members

`pscale org member list` is read-only and paginated. Use `--query` to filter by name or email prefix, and page through large organizations with `--page`/`--per-page`. `show`, `update`, and `remove` accept either an email address or the `USER_ID` from `list`.

```bash
pscale org member list --org <org> --page 1 --per-page 100 --format json
pscale org member list --org <org> --query <name-or-email-prefix> --format json
pscale org member show <email-or-user-id> --org <org> --format json
```

### Update or remove members

Only organization admins can update another member's role or remove someone else. Nobody can change their own role. A member can remove themselves from the organization, but the last admin cannot be removed. Assignable roles are `admin`, `member`, and `analyst`.

```bash
# Inspect the target first
pscale org member show <email-or-user-id> --org <org> --format json

# After explicit approval for the exact member and role
pscale org member update <email-or-user-id> --org <org> --role analyst --format json

# After explicit approval for the exact member and cleanup flags
pscale org member remove <email-or-user-id> --org <org> \
  --delete-passwords \
  --delete-service-tokens \
  --format json

# Verify after the write
pscale org member show <email-or-user-id> --org <org> --format json
pscale org member list --org <org> --format json
```

Treat updates and removals as external access-control writes. `--force` on remove only skips the confirmation prompt; it is not approval. Do not use `--delete-passwords` or `--delete-service-tokens` when removing yourself.

### Update organization settings

`pscale org update` sends only flags explicitly supplied. It can change billing email, identity-provider-managed-role behavior, and billing spend alerts. These are organization-wide settings; confirm the exact target organization and proposed diff, and obtain explicit approval before running the update.

```bash
# Optional: confirms only the locally active organization name; it does not inspect settings
pscale org show --format json

# After approval for the exact org and values
pscale org update --org <org> \
  --billing-email billing@example.com \
  --spend-alert \
  --spend-alert-amount 2500 \
  --format json

# Verification: the update's JSON response above returns the resulting settings;
# `pscale org show` only prints the locally active org name and ignores --org
```

`--idp-sso-managed-roles` controls roles from the SSO profile; `--idp-managed-roles` controls roles from directory sync. They are mutually exclusive when enabled: enabling either one explicitly turns the other off, and enabling both in one command is rejected. Passing one as `false` leaves the other setting unchanged. `--spend-alert-amount` must be a valid monthly amount. Do not claim that disabling spend alerts clears the stored amount; the CLI validates contradictory combinations rather than silently dropping them.

### Manage organization SSO

Always pass an explicit `--org` for SSO commands instead of relying on the locally active organization. Start with the read-only status command and prefer JSON so resource IDs, `domain_verification_url`, and generated `next_steps` remain available. Treat `next_steps` as state-aware guidance to review, not as commands to execute without the same approval gates as direct requests.

```bash
# Read-only inventory
pscale org sso show --org <org> --format json
pscale org sso domain list --org <org> --format json
pscale org sso domain show <domain-id> --org <org> --format json

# After explicit approval, enable SSO
pscale org sso enable --org <org> --format json

# If enable returns domain_verification_url, open it in an approved browser flow.
# Prefer --wait: it waits for a new domain ID, then polls that domain to a terminal state.
pscale org sso domain verify --org <org> --format json \
  --wait --wait-timeout 10m

# Configure the identity provider only after a domain is verified
pscale org sso configure --org <org> --format json

# Enable directory sync only after the SSO profile is configured
pscale org sso directory enable --org <org> --format json

# Choose exactly one approved source for organization role management
pscale org update --org <org> --idp-sso-managed-roles=true --format json
pscale org update --org <org> --idp-managed-roles=true --format json
```

`configure`, `directory enable`, and `domain verify` return `portal_url`, `browser_opened`, and `next_steps`. If `browser_opened` is false, open `portal_url` through the approved browser flow; do not treat URL creation as proof that the portal work completed. `enable --format json` does not open the verification portal and instead includes `domain_verification_url` when one is available. After each portal step, re-run `sso show`; after domain verification, also re-run `domain list` and `domain show <domain-id>`.

Without `--wait`, `domain verify` cannot identify the new domain because the portal call returns only a URL. With `--wait`, the CLI snapshots the existing domains, waits for a new domain ID to appear, and then polls it until `verified` or `failed`; a timeout or interrupted command is an unconfirmed outcome, so inspect `domain list` before retrying.

### Disable or remove SSO resources

Disabling SSO, disabling directory sync, and deleting a domain are access-control writes. Confirm the exact organization/domain, expected user impact, recovery plan, and resulting role-management source before approval. JSON/non-interactive execution requires `--force`; that flag only skips the prompt and is not approval.

```bash
# Inspect first
pscale org sso show --org <org> --format json
pscale org sso domain show <domain-id> --org <org> --format json

# Run exactly the approved destructive action
pscale org sso directory disable --org <org> --format json --force
pscale org sso domain delete <domain-id> --org <org> --format json --force
pscale org sso disable --org <org> --format json --force

# Verify the exact target afterward
pscale org sso show --org <org> --format json
pscale org sso domain list --org <org> --format json
```

Directory-sync disable removes non-admin directory members. Domain deletion can invalidate the SSO setup path, and SSO disable changes organization-wide authentication behavior. Never chain these operations from returned `next_steps`; apply one approved write at a time and read back the resulting state.

### Manage organization teams

Team commands are organization-scoped and paginated. List and show teams before changing membership or deleting anything.

```bash
pscale org team list --org <org> --page 1 --per-page 100 --format json
pscale org team show <team-id> --org <org> --format json
pscale org team member list <team-id> --org <org> --format json

# Writes require explicit approval for the exact org, team, and user/member
pscale org team create --org <org> --name <name> --description <description> --format json
pscale org team update <team-id> --org <org> --name <new-name> --format json
pscale org team member add <team-id> <email-or-user-id> --org <org> --format json
pscale org team member remove <team-id> <email-or-user-id> --org <org> --format json
pscale org team delete <team-id> --org <org>
```

Deleting a team or removing a team member can remove access and optionally delete passwords created through the team. Avoid `--force` unless non-interactive execution was explicitly approved, and verify the team/member list afterward. Team-member JSON output omits password metadata; do not infer credential cleanup from hidden fields.

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot see expected databases

**Solution:** Check current organization

```bash
pscale org show
pscale org switch <correct-org>
```
