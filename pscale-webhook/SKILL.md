# pscale webhook

Manage database webhooks and their event subscriptions.

## Inspect first

```bash
set -o pipefail
pscale webhook list <database> --org <org> --format json |
  jq 'map(del(.secret))'
```

Use the redacted list for routine identifiers and persisted state. Webhook resource JSON from create, show, list, or update can contain the signing `secret` because the CLI serializes the raw API model. Do not capture it unredacted in logs, chat, or agent context; only an intentional create/show flow that writes directly to an approved secret store should retain it. `pscale webhook show` deliberately returns the secret, and human output has a `secret` column. When an exact show is unavoidable for non-secret inspection, pipe JSON directly through `jq 'del(.secret)'` before capturing output. `authorization_header_configured` reveals only whether the separate Authorization header is configured, never its value.

## Create

```bash
pscale webhook create <database> \
  --url https://hooks.example.com/planetscale \
  --events branch.ready,deploy_request.opened \
  --enabled=true \
  --org <org> --format json
```

`--url` is required. Confirm the destination host, TLS endpoint, subscribed events, enabled state, and receiver ownership before creation. Successful `create` output includes the generated webhook signing `secret` in both human and JSON formats. Capture it from that response directly into an approved secret manager; do not print it into logs, paste it into tickets, or commit it. Treat the create response as the one reliable capture point.

`--events` accepts a comma-separated list. Published event names are:

```text
branch.anomaly
branch.out_of_memory
branch.primary_promoted
branch.ready
branch.schema_recommendation
branch.sleeping
branch.start_maintenance
backup.failed
backup.succeeded
cluster.storage
database.access_request
deploy_request.closed
deploy_request.errored
deploy_request.in_progress
deploy_request.opened
deploy_request.pending_cutover
deploy_request.queued
deploy_request.reverted
deploy_request.schema_applied
keyspace.storage
webhook.test
```

The CLI forwards event strings to the PlanetScale API without client-side validation. Use the [`events` enum in the webhook API reference](https://planetscale.com/docs/api/reference/create_webhook) for accepted names and the [webhook events reference](https://planetscale.com/docs/api/webhook-events) for trigger and payload details; the general events page can lag the API enum. An unknown or unsupported name is not normalized by the CLI and can fail at the API.

### Authorization header

`--authorization-header` accepts the complete HTTP `Authorization` value, such as `Bearer …`. It is a secret-bearing argument. Do not place a literal credential in documentation, shell history, logs, chat, source control, or process captures. Use an approved secret source and preserve only the variable reference in reusable command text:

```bash
pscale webhook create <database> \
  --url https://hooks.example.com/planetscale \
  --authorization-header "$PLANETSCALE_WEBHOOK_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER" \
  --org <org> --format json
```

Do not run this form until the environment variable is populated outside the agent-visible context. Verify only `authorization_header_configured: true`; never attempt to read the value back.

## Update

Pass at least one of `--url`, `--authorization-header`, `--clear-authorization-header`, `--events`, or `--enabled`. Only supplied fields change, but `--events` replaces the entire subscription list rather than appending to it. Read the current list and include every event that should remain subscribed.

```bash
# Save redacted pre-change state for rollback
set -o pipefail
pscale webhook list <database> --org <org> --format json |
  jq --arg id '<webhook-id>' '.[] | select(.id == $id) | del(.secret)'

# Disable or change subscriptions
pscale webhook update <database> <webhook-id> \
  --enabled=false \
  --events branch.ready \
  --org <org> --format json | jq 'del(.secret)'

# Remove the configured header explicitly
pscale webhook update <database> <webhook-id> \
  --clear-authorization-header \
  --org <org> --format json | jq 'del(.secret)'

# Each synchronous update response is the read-back for that change
```

Before updating, save the redacted non-secret configuration (`url`, `events`, and `enabled`) and ensure the current Authorization value is available separately if rollback may need to restore it—the API does not return that header value. To roll back, re-run `webhook update` with the previous `--url`, complete `--events` list, and explicit `--enabled=<true|false>` values, plus either the prior `--authorization-header` value or `--clear-authorization-header`. The synchronous update response verifies persisted non-secret state; use `webhook test` to verify receiver behavior.

`--authorization-header` and `--clear-authorization-header` are mutually exclusive. An empty `--authorization-header` value is rejected; use the clear flag. Changing or clearing authentication can interrupt deliveries, so coordinate the receiver update and verify `authorization_header_configured` afterward.

## Test and delete

`webhook test` sends a real event to the external receiver. Confirm the destination and downstream side effects before running it. A successful CLI response proves dispatch was accepted, not that the receiver processed it; verify receiver-side evidence when available.

```bash
set -o pipefail
pscale webhook list <database> --org <org> --format json |
  jq 'map(del(.secret))'
pscale webhook test <database> <webhook-id> --org <org> --format json
```

Deletion has no CLI confirmation flag. Treat it as destructive: inspect the exact webhook, inventory dependencies, obtain explicit approval, delete, and read back the list.

```bash
set -o pipefail
pscale webhook list <database> --org <org> --format json |
  jq 'map(del(.secret))'
pscale webhook delete <database> <webhook-id> --org <org> --format json
pscale webhook list <database> --org <org> --format json |
  jq 'map(del(.secret))'
```

When scripting against `--format json`, probe one representative response first and handle optional fields defensively. The CLI serializes the underlying API webhook model for JSON, while human and CSV output use a smaller normalized view, so fields can differ and the JSON model can gain fields as the API evolves. Do not build strict decoders from the command-reference snippets or assume table and JSON output have identical fields.
